Write a C program that uses a structure to store information about a car, including its make, model, and year, and then prints out that information.

#include<stdio.h>
struct car
{
  char model[20];
  int year;
  char make[20];
};
int main()
{
 struct car mycar={"tesla",2024,"steel"};
  printf("the model is %s\n",mycar.model);
  printf("the year is %d\n",mycar.year);
  printf("the make is %s\n",mycar.make);
  return 0;
}
